## App
### Making models to another directory
If you need to create Models to another directory, do this:
```ShellScript
  php artisan make:model Path/to/Directory/Model
```
This code will create the file Model.php into app/Path/to/Directory. Its namespace will be the same of your directory's path.

## Database
### Foreign keys on Laravel's migrations
You **need** to declare the foreign key as an unsigned integer. Nobody seems to know why exactly.

## Views
### Scripts
Apparently, all scripts outside of sections are not executed.

## Routes
### route vs url
Both generates a full url from a string. 
* **url** needs a parameter which is a local url from the project. 
* **route** needs a parameter which is the name of a Route (routes are declared on routes/something.php).

**route** depends only on the Route name. So if you name a Route and use **route** to generate a link for this route, you can change anytime the actual url of this Route and the link generated by **route** will be changed too.
